# Introduction to Data Science 

[ Unit 1: Aug 16-22 ]{@date}

This unit defines the concept of "data science" and provides an overview of the course schedule for the semester. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will:
* Be able to define data science and provide examples of use in the public sector.
* Create your first R Markdown document.

## What is Data Science?

> A data scientist is a person who should be able to leverage existing data sources, and create new ones as needed in order to extract meaningful information and actionable insights. These insights can be used to drive business decisions and changes intended to achieve business goals... ‘The Perfect Data Scientist’ is the individual who is equally strong in business, programming, statistics, and communication.

FROM: [ What Is Data Science, and What Does a Data Scientist Do? ]{@reading https://www.innoarchitech.com/what-is-data-science-does-data-scientist-do/}

> Universities can hardly turn out data scientists fast enough. To meet demand from employers, the United States will need to increase the number of graduates with skills handling large amounts of data by as much as 60 percent.

FROM: [Data Science: The Numbers of Our Lives, The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/education/edlife/universities-offer-courses-in-a-hot-new-field-data-science.html)

> “Data Scientists identify complex business problems whilst leveraging data value. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team with data architects, data engineers, analysts and others.”

FROM: [Data Scientist Career Pathways in Government](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/data_scientist_career_path/blob/master/index.md).

# On Being Nonprofit   
["slides"]{@lecture 03-deck.html}

* By the end of this unit, you will:
  + Develop critical observations about the founding of new public charities
  + Recognize and prioritize the range of ways that people reference the nonprofit sector

I'm also interested in your development of basic professional skills, such as using Excel to work with and draw conclusions from data.  At the end of this Unit, you need to be familiar with the framework by which Peter Frumkin organizes the sector and the layout of his book, which also structures the layout of this class.

## Assigned Readings  

* Frumkin, On Being Nonprofit, Chapter 1
* Arizona Nonprofit Incorporation:
  + [Instructions:](http://www.azcc.gov/Divisions/Corporations/forms/starpas/instructionsSTPS/C011i-Instructions-Articles-of-Inc-Nonprofit-STPS.pdf)

## Exercises  

* Data Exercise

Part 1: Get the IRS file for nonprofits in your state
Follow this URL:  https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf
Download the Exempt Organization Business Master File Extract Excel file for your state:
1. Click on your state.  You should be given the option to save a copy of the Excel file, or your browser will automatically download it. 
2. Save the file. (Note above the U.S. map that the IRS tells you the DATE at which it last uploaded data.  As I write this I'm seeing 06/13/2016, but you may very well be seeing a more current date.  Whenever I save this file, I put that DATE in the filename, so I always know what exactly my datafile represents.)
